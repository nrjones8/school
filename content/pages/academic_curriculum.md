Summary: Overview of curriculum

At [HS], the curriculum *student*-driven and encourages students to explore their
interests in depth. The curriculum at [HS] is broken down into three types
of classes: core classes, seminars, and projects. 
There are only four graduation requirements, which are discussed below. Outside
of these requirements, students are expected to take either 1-3 classes and a project,
or 3-4 classes. All students are required to get their advisors' approval before
a term begins. 

## Core Classes
Each core subject has two offerings: a Beginning class and an Advanced class. If a
student completes both and wants to explore the topic in more detail, (s)he can
propose a seminar, take an already existing seminar, or use the topic as the basis for 
a project. 

## Seminars
Seminars explore a particular topic in more depth, or focus on one specific area outside
of the material in core classes. Both teachers and students propose seminars; when there is
enough interest from both students and a teacher, the teacher will begin to plan and learn
the material necessary to teach the seminar. Generally, the seminar will be taught one to
two terms after its proposal is accepted. Seminars are often used to prepare students
for a future project.

## Projects
In addition to taking core classes and seminars, students may choose to work on
term-long projects. While working on a project, students are expected to take fewer
courses and spend more time working independently on their project. 
Before beginning a project, students must create a proposal
and identify a faculty member to oversee the project. All projects must be approved by
a student's advisor and the overseer of the project. 

If the project requires some background content, students may first need to propose 
a seminar. Students may work in small groups on projects, though most projects 
will be individual.

## Graduation Requirements

##### *Popular Culture: Awareness and Criticism*
A writing and discussion heavy course, students analyze cultural artifacts, 
including TV shows, movies, music, fashion, sports, advertisements, and more. 
While the teacher provides some core material, students are responsible for
bringing in content that they see in popular culture on a regular basis. 

##### *Current Events: Placing the News in Context*
A reading, writing, and discussion based course dedicated to understanding the news.
Students read a number of news sources: newspapers, online articles, magazines, etc. 
There is a strong emphasis on considering the source of news, and the biases that
any news source provides. Students keep a running “reaction” journal, 
written in at least once a week. Some readings will be assigned, while others will be
based on what students find most interesting at the time.[look up Measured Thinking!].

##### *Race in America: Past, Present, and Future:*
A three-term course sequence studying how the concept of race has evolved
in the history of the United States. The Past unit will focus on the history of 
race in America and seeks to frame the Present unit. The Present and Future units 
will incorporate white privilege, the media’s portrayal of race, personal experiences,
and racial identity development. Students are encouraged to take this course towards
the beginning of their high school career in order to allow time to propose seminars
and projects based on topics discussed here. 

##### *Community Outreach*
Students must spend one project cycle working with a community partner. 
Depending on the students skill level/interest at the time, this project 
may involve a student volunteering, shadowing, or working as an intern. 
This requirement can be fulfilled in many different ways; a student 
interested in art may paint a mural somewhere in the community; 
a student interested in cooking may create a community cookbook 
or cook at a homeless shelter; a student interested in technology 
may provide computer help to adults who may be less computer-literate.
