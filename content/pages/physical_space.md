 There are a number of different types of spaces in ILL:

* *Advisory* spaces are large, open, and decorated with art, 
posters, and anything else that members of the advisory choose. 
Each learner (student or teacher) in the advisory has his or her own desk in 
this area.

* *Conference Rooms* include erasable walls for learners to write on 
and a TV for projecting a computer screen. 

* The *Common Area* sits in the center of the first floor. Inside there are 
a number of circular tables, couches, and two large monitors. The common area 
is used as a lunch room and available for students to use throughout the day 
whenever a learner needs a place to work. In addition, the large monitors are used 
for presentations of projects at the end of a term. 

* *Small study areas* are designated quiet areas; while the open nature of 
advisories and the common area work well for some learners, the study rooms 
provide a quieter, more private space. In addition to being open to learners, 
one of the quiet rooms is reserved at all times as a “safe space” to be used by 
student counselors to meet with students needing a place to talk in private 

* Bathrooms are centrally located in order to encourage small interactions in 
passing between students and faculty (across all years). All bathrooms
are individual, non-gendered rooms.
