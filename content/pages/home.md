Thank you for visiting The Institute for Lifelong Learners! 
The Institute of Lifelong Learning (ILL) is a project-based high school 
which emphasizes personal identity development, a student-driven curriculum,
and independence of its students. 
Students at ILL are given the freedom to choose from a variety of core classes,
seminars, and projects: see more by visiting the 
[curriculum page](pages/curriculum.html). 

Students generally take 3-4 core/seminar classes, or 2 core/seminar classes
and a project. Each day includes built-in work time and two meetings with
[advisories](pages/advisories.html). A typical day is shown below:

ILL has three terms per school year; each term lasts approximately three months. 
At the end of a term, learners are given an approximately one month break. Rather than
one large summer break, learners have three shorter one month breaks built into 
the year.
