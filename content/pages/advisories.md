Summary: Description of advisories

All students and all teachers at [HS] are part of one of four 
(blue, red, purple, and green) advisories. Each advisory includes students
in all grades (an approximately equal number from each) and a number of teachers.

Within an advisory, each teacher has a smaller group called a *mentorship* group
that includes at least one student from each grade. Mentorship groups
are designed to foster a sense of personal connection among students of all ages
and provide role models for students as they grow at [HS]. 

Each day begins with a 15 minute advisory meeting and ends with a 25 minute advisory
meeting. Some of these meetings are with the whole advisory, while some are in the smaller
mentorship groups.

Advisory meetings in general are informal check-ins; in the morning, both 
students and teachers discuss their plans, goals, and worries for the day. 
At the end of the day, students and teachers both reflect on what they worked on that day, and 
come up with goals for the next day. If something was frustrating or bothered the
student during the day, advisory is the perfect time to bring it up for discussion.
