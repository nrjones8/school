Summary: Description of advisories and teachers

## Advisories

All students and all teachers at ILL are part of one of four 
(blue, red, purple, and green) advisories. Each advisory includes students
in all grades (an approximately equal number from each), a number of teachers,
and one project coordinator who oversees all projects within the 
advisory. 


Within an advisory, each teacher has a smaller group called a *mentorship* group
that includes at least one student from each grade. Mentorship groups
are designed to foster a sense of personal connection among students of all ages
and provide role models for students as they grow at ILL.

Each day begins with a 15 minute advisory meeting and ends with a 25 minute advisory
meeting. Some of these meetings are with the whole advisory, while some are in the smaller
mentorship groups.

Advisory meetings in general are informal check-ins; in the morning, both 
students and teachers discuss their plans, goals, and worries for the day. 
At the end of the day, students and teachers both reflect on what they worked on that day, and 
come up with goals for the next day. If something was frustrating or bothered the
student during the day, advisory is the perfect time to bring it up for discussion. 

## Teachers

Teachers teach a combination of core classes, seminars, and also oversee projects.
In addition to teaching, they are expected to propose seminars periodically: these
seminars can be based on their own interest, but also must take into account
seminars proposed by students. A seminar is accepted once there is enough interest
from both students and teachers. Once accepted, a teacher generally has one 
or two terms (break time included) to learn the material necessary to facilitate
the seminar.

Teachers are assumed to be curious, life-long learners, and eager to learn 
in addition to teach. As the world changes, so too does ILL, its teachers,
and its curriculum. For example, computer science was an afterthought 
ten years ago; while high schools in general struggle to adapt to changing 
trends in society, ILL offers the flexibility necessary to adapt to a changing world.
